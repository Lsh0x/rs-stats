//! # Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
//!
//! This module implements the cumulative distribution function for normal distributions.
//!
//! ## Mathematical Definition
//! The CDF of a normal distribution is defined as:
//!
//! Φ(x) = 0.5 * (1 + erf((x - μ) / (σ√2)))
//!
//! where:
//! - x is the value at which to evaluate the CDF
//! - μ is the mean of the distribution
//! - σ is the standard deviation of the distribution
//! - erf is the error function
//!
//! ## Key Properties
//! - Φ(-∞) = 0
//! - Φ(∞) = 1
//! - Φ(μ) = 0.5
//! - Φ(μ + a) = 1 - Φ(μ - a) (symmetry property)

/// Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a normal distribution
///
/// The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to x.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `x` - The value at which to evaluate the CDF
/// * `avg` - The mean (μ) of the distribution
/// * `stddev` - The standard deviation (σ) of the distribution
///
/// # Returns
/// The probability that a random variable is less than or equal to x
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use rs_stats::prob::cumulative_distrib;
///
/// // Calculate CDF for standard normal distribution at x = 0
/// let cdf = cumulative_distrib(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
/// assert!((cdf - 0.5).abs() < 1e-8);
///
/// // Calculate CDF for non-standard normal distribution
/// let cdf = cumulative_distrib(12.0, 10.0, 2.0);
/// assert!((cdf - 0.841344746).abs() < 1e-8);
